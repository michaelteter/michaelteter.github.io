<p>Bitbucket CI pipeline on Nodejs project with Mocha test never completes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm test</code> phase.</p>

<p>I was exploring Bitbucket’s continuous integration pipeline feature, following this
<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/tutorials/continuous-integration-tutorial">Atlassian tutorial</a>, but there were a few problems.  The most significant problem was that
the pipelines would never complete: they would hang on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm test</code>.</p>

<p>Some of the problems with the tutorial were formatting or other little mistakes
made by the author (excusable, but a bit surprising… nobody edited it?)
Other issues were just differences of user interface of today’s Bitbucket vs
what the guide author had available at time of publishing.</p>

<p>However, <strong>the cause of the hanging pipeline is that Mocha changed its default behavior
from auto-exit to keep-running</strong>.  Thus, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm test</code> would never exit on its own.  So when
pipeline would run it, pipeline would hang on that step.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, and new to the Bitbucket pipelines, you might inadvertently eat up all of your CI minutes… you have to manually stop them if they won’t end naturally!</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>The solution is to modify the project’s package.json file, updating the <a href="https://mochajs.org">Mocha</a>
line to this</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">scripts"</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">{</span>
    <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">test"</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">mocha</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">--exit"</span>
  <span class="pi">}</span><span class="err">,</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a href="https://mochajs.org/#command-line-usage">mocha command line options</a></p>

<p>With this change, Mocha will now exit when all tests are complete, and your Bitbucket pipeline will continue to its natural end.</p>
