## Bad User Interfaces

Plenty of examples, everywhere - in our own work, in our companies, and also in big, super-well-funded companies.  Recent HN posts have illustrated this.

No shame on Netflix, because they are (made up of) human(s).  Here's a UI failure.

Like the preview?  Click the checkmark.  ... Oops!  Already added it to your list?  You just inadvertently removed it.  

Why is the checkmark button not filled like the Play button?  You think it needs to be filled to be "true".

Small UI mistake, but almost certainly one that has confused a lot of users.  (Yes, I post this because I fell for it too!)  Do you see the tooltip *Remove from My List*, or do you see the empty check circle?  **IT MUST BE FILLED!**
