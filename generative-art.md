title: Generative Art

Recently I have begun exploring visual art using algorithms - <em>generative art</em>.  While my methods are rather
crude, I find some of the output pleasing.

Unlike some generative artists, I currently use no mathematical algorithms aside from random number generators.  The
effects I get come from the management of parameters and limits provided to the random number generator.  Through
these parameters (and gradual improvement/modification of my algorithm that drives the drawing), I can find patterns
that feel more natural - more human - than purely mathematical formulas.  While I find the math-based art attractive,
it feels more like visual representations of math.

My goal is to find that balance between complexity and repetitive patterns that is pleasing but not dull.
