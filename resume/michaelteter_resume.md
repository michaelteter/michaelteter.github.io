## Sales Engineer | Solutions Consultant | Senior Software Engineer | Solutions Architect | Technical Lead

As a technical leader with over two decades of engineering experience, I excel at translating complex technology into business value for stakeholders at all levels. I've designed and delivered scalable solutions across diverse industries, combining deep technical expertise in backend systems, APIs, and infrastructure with a proven ability to understand customer needs and communicate solutions that drive measurable outcomes.

My unique strength lies in bridging the gap between engineering and business teams — whether mentoring developers, automating customer onboarding, or collaborating with product and sales to align technical capabilities with market opportunities. I bring hands-on experience with modern programming languages, database systems, and performance optimization, paired with a consultative approach that prioritizes understanding business challenges before proposing solutions. Having thrived in remote, cross-functional environments using Agile methodologies, I'm skilled at building trust, managing expectations, and delivering results that improve both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
