## Technical Solutions Consultant | Sales Engineer

Technical Solutions Consultant with extensive experience bridging business needs and engineering capabilities. I specialize in understanding unique customer scenarios, translating requirements into practical technical approaches, and guiding stakeholders toward clear, confident decisions. My strength is connecting the 'what' and the 'how', quickly grasping the structure of a system, mapping it to a customer’s goals, and communicating the best path forward.

With a background spanning software engineering, architecture, integration, system troubleshooting, and customer-facing consulting, I excel in roles where analytical thinking, clear communication, and problem-solving are essential. I am the person who diagnoses ambiguous problems, designs a workable plan, and ensures the right solution gets built — whether by me or by the teams I collaborate with. Comfortable in sales cycles, technical evaluations, onboarding, and support handoffs, I help customers understand technology in business terms and help teams deliver solutions that fit. I have collaborated with clients around the world and am comfortable traveling extensively to support discovery sessions, technical evaluations, and successful solution adoption.
